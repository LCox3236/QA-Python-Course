# QA-Python-Course

The Main Part of this Project can be found in the API Folder.

This Allows this user to interact with the Dummy JSON API.
https://dummyjson.com/

The user will be asked if they want to either get new data from the API, or interact
with the existing database.

If choosing to grab new data from the API, the different options will be displayed.
Currently only the 'Quote' feature of DummyJSON is active.

If choosing to interact with the database, the user will be asked which table they require.
Currently only the 'Quote' Table is active.

Once a table is selected, the user can select whether they want to read data from the 
database or modify the data. This includes updating an existing row or deleting one.

The code has been created in a way that it should be easier to add new tables and API endpoints
with minimal change, reusability is the goal and as such functions have been built with parameters
where possible.
